    "#### 1. Type of Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear regression is used for regression problems, where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical output (dependent variable) based on one or more independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic regression is used for classification problems, where the goal is to predict one of two or more discrete classes or categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Output Variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The output of linear regression is a continuous value, typically a real number. It models the relationship between the independent variables and the expected mean value of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The output of logistic regression is a probability that an input data point belongs to a particular class. It models the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., 0 or 1, yes or no).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear regression is suitable for scenarios like predicting house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. Here, the target variable (house price) is continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Logistic regression is more appropriate for scenarios like:\n",
    "- Predicting whether an email is spam (binary classification: spam or not spam) based on email content features.\n",
    "- Predicting whether a customer will churn (leave) a subscription service (binary classification: churn or not churn) based on historical customer data.\n",
